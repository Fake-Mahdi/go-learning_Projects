GoRoutines are huge and one of most aspect that can take ur Go level into a higher levels
So what are goroutine : 
            goroutine are light weight threat that run inside a threat managed by the Go runtime also they run asynchronos
            how they give advantage : 
                first we need to understand what are threat threat are task that schuddle by OS the kernel used by process
                a process is a living instance of program mean each function or task inside a program need a threat
                    threat disadvantage : they are slow to creat and very consuming
                        here when Goroutine shine they lived inside threat and they are fast to creat plus u can run more than one inside a threat wich is huge for
                        performance plus they are managed by Go-runtime exactly by go schudle wich help us to creat true high performance concurency and real pallarism
                        go Routines lived and dies why Main goroutine 


NOTES FOR ME IN THE FUTURE:

1- while coding keep in mind that Goroutines are for async operation mean that task that i want to run in concurency should not be linked also for max and clean code
used channel to transfer data between Goroutine
2- runing multipe GO routine does not guarnte performance cause they lived in same threat mean same Cpu cors this can creat a problem u need to mange them
equally between cors of cpu
